7/13
- added torque filtering logic

- testing performed on kW logic
- repeat "no compatible" issue resolved by switching to ALERT 

7/18

- no compatible motors found bug occurs when calculated in hp and switching to kw (FIX ME)











TODO - PHASE 1:

- add torque shading via 10% rule --INCOMPLETE--
- add enter press to calculate --INCOMPLETE--
- move calculate button to results line --INCOMPLETE--
- update wordpress code once the above has been completed --INCOMPLETE--
