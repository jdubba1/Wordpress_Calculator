CHANGELOG

7/12
- Added diameter column
- updated naming conventions
- removed missing spec motor
- fixed clear button issue
- fixed sticky results table headers
- added hp / kW conversion and responsive change in results table

7/13
- added torque filtering logic
- results sorted by lowest matching torque first then ascending (BASIC SORTING / ADVANCED SAVING FOR PHASE 2)
- testing performed on kW logic
- repeat "no compatible" issue resolved by switching to ALERT 











TODO - PHASE 1:

- add torque shading --INCOMPLETE--
- add enter press to calculate --INCOMPLETE--
- move calculate button to results line --INCOMPLETE--
- motor array as JSON file? --INCOMPLETE-- {{LOW PRIORITY // LOTS OF FORMATTING ISSUES }}
- update wordpress code once the above has been completed --INCOMPLETE--
- FINAL PHASE1 TESTING  -- INCOMPLETE -- 



DISCUSSION:
- catalogue number on right side of table??
- no compatible motors were found as an alert? or as html element
