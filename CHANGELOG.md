7/13
- added torque filtering logic
- results sorted by lowest matching torque first then ascending (BASIC SORTING / ADVANCED SAVING FOR PHASE 2)
- testing performed on kW logic
- repeat "no compatible" issue resolved by switching to ALERT 

7/18

- no compatible motors found bug occurs when calculated in hp and switching to kw (FIX ME)
- add torque shading added (yellow if geq torque and leq max torque)
- added calculate on enter press
- fixed sticky compatible motors div

TODO - PHASE 1:

- order motors in a different way
- update wordpress code once the above has been completed --INCOMPLETE--
- motor array as JSON file? --INCOMPLETE-- LOW PRIORITY//FORMATTING ISSUES
- FINAL PHASE1 TESTING  -- INCOMPLETE -- 


DISCUSSION
    - catalogue number on right side of table??
    - no compatible motors were found as an alert? or as html element
